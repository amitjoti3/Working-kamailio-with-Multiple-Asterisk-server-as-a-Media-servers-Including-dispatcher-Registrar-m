in this project, we tested with kamailio server with multiple asterisk servers.


we used dispatcher module.

1.you need to change the database connection in Kamailio cfg files.
2.you need to add asterisks servers ip in dispatcher table in Kamailio database or by siremis.
3 you need to open the 5060 and rtp port range on kamailio server.
4.in this file we did not creating any extensions in Kamailio we use asterisk database table for extensions authentication.
5.once your kamailio file is connected with asterisks database those Mentioned in cfg file then you can get registered softphone.
6.post adding the dispatcher ip in table or by siremis, you will get the registration request on all asterisks servers those you kept in set ID 1 in dispatcher table.
7.post adding ip in set ID 1 you will start getting calls to your asterisks servers 1 by 1. i used round robin.
8.make sure you asterisks dispatcher IPs are reachable by command " kamcmd dispatcher.list "   or you can also load the dispatcher.


test it and share feedback.

also 1 trunk based file added.

in this file we used indian trunk configuration and routing calls to dispatcher asterisks by set id  and 

if calls comes with prefix 133 from asterisk then in Kamailio we remove the prefix and route to trunk.

and rest calls routes ate as earlier.

we used RTP engine in this seniero..
